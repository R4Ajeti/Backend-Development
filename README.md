# Backend Development

### Descriptions
> All in One pack from development to docker image! \
Modern API constructor that helps developers to interact with back-end services \
Modern database: Super fast response (on query search time computation O(1)), high performance (with horizontal scaling) and reliable source (with triple validation processes Client + API + Server) \
Unit testing with at least 75% of coverage, furthermore end-to-end testing 100% of it's coverage \
Simple client-side response (Front-END)
